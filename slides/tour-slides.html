    <h1>Tour - Slides</h1>
    <p>Here's some useful knowledge about slides (if you're looking for examples of slides, this slide's code can be
        found <a href="https://github.com/EthanJustice/moulin/blob/master/slides/tour-slides.html">here</a>).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slides have scoped styles (<a
                href="https://github.com/EthanJustice/moulin#scoped-css-implementation-notes">implementation notes</a>)
            - that is, any <code>style</code> element within a slide
            will be scoped to that
            slide only (for example, <b>this is a <code>b</code> element that has styles unique to this slide</b> -
            check the next slide to see that it works)</li>
        <li>Any element works - even <code>iframes</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A guide to what happens before a slide is added:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Slide content is fetched based on the <code>data-next</code> attribute of each slide (or loaded from the
            cache)</li>
        <li>The content is run through the scoped CSS parser</li>
        <li>If there's a permalink, the proper slide is navigated to</li>
    </ol>
