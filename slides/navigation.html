            Pressing a number key will navigate to the specified slide (e.g.
            pressing <kbd>2</kbd> will go to the second slide), except for the
            <kbd>9</kbd> key, which goes to the last slide
        </li>
        <li>
            The list of slides and their load times can be viewed by pressing
            <kbd>s</kbd>, and can be closed by pressing the key again
        </li>
        <li>
            The list of general load times functions the same way as the list of
            slides, but uses the <kbd>d</kbd> key
        </li>
        <li>
            If you're lost, pressing <kbd>h</kbd> always brings you back to the
            slides
        </li>
