    <h1>Tour - Basic Concepts</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Slides are individual HTML files, prefetched at runtime</li>
        <li>Slides can be cached (in <a href="https://github.com/EthanJustice/moulin#keys">production mode</a>) for
            faster loading times</li>
        <li>The config file is the second-most important part (after the slides themselves, of course) - it controls
            many aspects of the overall presentation</li>
        <li>There's also a dashboard to see how long things take to load, and a preview page for the slides that does
            the same thing (these can be accessed by pressing the <kbd>d</kbd> and <kbd>s</kbd> keys, respectively).
        </li>
        <li>Moulin is bare-bones, making it easily customisable (see the <a
                href="https://github.com/EthanJustice/moulin#keys">global stylesheet</a> config key)</li>
        <li>Moulin emits 10 hooks to provide granular control for over-the-top effects</li>
    </ul>
